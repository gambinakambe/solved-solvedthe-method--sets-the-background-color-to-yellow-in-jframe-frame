import java.awt.*;import java.awt.event.*;import javax.swing.*;

public class Quiz3A extends JFrame implements ActionListener{public Quiz3A(){JButton okButton = new JButton(“OK”);add(okButton);}

public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){System.out.println(“The OK button is clicked”);}

public static void main(String[] args){JFrame frame = new Quiz3A();frame.setSize(300, 300);frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);frame.setVisible(true);}} Question 13 options: The actionPerformed method is not executed when you click the OK button, because no instance of Quiz3A is registered with okButton The program has a compilation error because no listeners are registered for okButton The message The OK button is clicked is displayed when you click the OK button The program has a runtime error because no listeners are registered with okButton Question 14 (5 points) The listener for an button event is an instance of ________. Question 14 options: KeyListener ActionListener MouseListener ItemListener Question 15 (5 points) Which of the following statements registers a panel object aPanel as a listener for a button variable aButton?

import java.awt.*;import java.awt.event.*;import javax.swing.*;

public class Quiz3B extends JFrame implements ActionListener{private JButton okButton = new JButton(“OK”);

public Quiz3B(){add(okButton);okButton.addActionListener(this);}

public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){System.out.println(“The OK button is clicked”);}

public static void main(String[] args){JFrame frame = new Quiz3B();frame.setSize(300, 300);frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);frame.setVisible(true);}} Question 16 options: okButton An anonymous object frame JButton Question 17 (5 points) What is the benefit of using adapter classes rather than listeners interfaces? Question 17 options: It enables multiple inheritance of classes It makes it unnecessary to implement unused event handling methods It makes the response time for responding to events much quicker It makes it possible to respond to several events at the same time Question 18 (5 points) In the program below, which object is listening for the events of okButton?

import java.awt.*;import java.awt.event.*;import javax.swing.*;

public class Quiz3C extends JFrame{private JButton okButton = new JButton(“OK”);

public Quiz3C(){add(okButton);okButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){@Overridepublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae){System.out.println(“The OK button is clicked”);}});}public static void main(String[] args){JFrame frame = new Quiz3C();frame.setSize(300, 300);frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);frame.setVisible(true);}} Question 18 options: An anonymous object frame JButton okButton Question 19 (5 points) Which of the following will occur if you fail to register an object as a listener for the click events of a button? Question 19 options: The containing frame will be considered as the default listener A compilation error will occur Nothing will happen when the button is clicked A class cast exception will be thrown at run-time Question 20 (5 points)
